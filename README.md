## This is a Rust rewrite of [Lanyard](https://github.com/Phineas/lanyard)
## üè∑Ô∏è Expose your Discord presence and activities to a RESTful API ~~and WebSocket~~ in less than 10 seconds

Lanyard-rust is a service that makes it easy to export your live Discord presence to an API endpoint (lanyard.devprits.ru/v1/users/:your_id) and ~~to a WebSocket (see below)~~(to be implemented later) for you to use wherever you want.
